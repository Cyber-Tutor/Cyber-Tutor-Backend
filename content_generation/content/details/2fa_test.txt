2FA is an extra layer of security used to make sure that people trying to gain access to an online account are who they say they are
2FA requires users to provide two separate forms of identification before granting access to an account
First factor is typically something you know, like a password or PIN
Second factor involves something you possess, such as a smartphone, security token, or smart card
2FA works by requiring users to enter their username and password (first factor) and then providing a second factor, usually in the form of a code sent to the user's mobile device
2FA setup process may vary slightly depending on the service
Services offer various 2FA methods, including SMS codes, authenticator apps, biometrics, or hardware tokens
Enable 2FA in account settings by navigating to the security settings and looking for an option related to Two-Factor Authentication or Multi-Factor Authentication
Choose your preferred 2FA method
If using an authenticator app, scan the QR code provided by the service or manually enter the key
Complete the setup by entering a generated code from the authenticator app or responding to an SMS
Some services provide backup codes in case you lose access to your 2FA device
Google Account 2FA setup: Go to your Google Account settings, navigate to Security, and enable 2-Step Verification
Facebook 2FA setup: Access your Facebook Security settings, locate Two-Factor Authentication, and choose your preferred method
2FA is a simple yet powerful way to enhance the security of your online accounts
2FA provides an additional layer of defense against unauthorized access
2FA combines something you know with something you possess
Hardware tokens are small, like a key fob, and produce a new numeric code every 30-seconds
Hardware tokens can be costly to distribute and easy to lose or misplace
Hardware tokens are not entirely safe from being hacked
SMS Text-Message and Voice-based 2FA involves sending a code to the user's mobile device
SMS Text-Message and Voice-based 2FA is not as secure as hardware tokens
Authenticator apps generate codes that can be used for 2FA
Authenticator apps are more secure than SMS Text-Message and Voice-based 2FA
Biometrics can be used for 2FA, such as fingerprint or facial recognition
Biometrics are more secure than SMS Text-Message and Voice-based 2FA and hardware tokens
