<h1>Introduction to Phishing</h1>

<p>Phishing is a type of cyberattack where malicious actors send messages pretending to be a trusted person or entity. These messages are designed to manipulate the recipient into performing an action, such as installing malware, clicking a malicious link or divulging sensitive information like access credentials.</p>

<p>Phishing attacks can take many forms, but the most common methods are email, text message (smishing) or phone call (vishing).</p>

<h2>How to Spot a Phishing Attack</h2>

<li><em>The message creates a sense of urgency or panic.</em></li>
<li><em>The message asks you to click on a link or open an attachment.</em></li>
<li><em>The message asks you to provide personal information, such as your password or credit card number.</em></li>
