Introduction to Phishing

Phishing is a type of cyberattack in which malicious actors send messages pretending to be a trusted person or entity. These messages are designed to trick the recipient into performing an action, such as clicking on a malicious link, downloading a malicious file, or divulging sensitive information such as access credentials.

Phishing is one of the most common types of cyberattacks, and it is responsible for a significant amount of financial loss and identity theft. In 2021, phishing attacks cost businesses an estimated $4.2 billion.

How Phishing Works

Phishing attacks rely on social engineering techniques to trick victims into taking an action that will compromise their security. These techniques include:

- Impersonation: Phishing emails often appear to come from a legitimate source, such as a bank, a government agency, or a well-known company. The sender's name and email address may be spoofed to make it appear as if the message is genuine.
- Urgency: Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency to pressure the victim into taking action. The email may claim that the victim's account has been compromised or that they need to take action to avoid a penalty.
- Curiosity: Phishing emails may also use curiosity to trick the victim into clicking on a malicious link or opening a malicious attachment. The email may claim to contain a video, a document, or other information that the victim will want to see.

How to Avoid Phishing

There are a number of things you can do to avoid falling victim to a phishing attack:

- Be suspicious of unsolicited emails. If you receive an email from someone you don't know, or if the email looks suspicious in any way, do not click on any links or open any attachments.
- Hover over links before clicking on them. This will show you the true destination of the link, which may be different from the displayed text.
- Look for misspellings and grammatical errors. Phishing emails often contain misspellings and grammatical errors, which can be a sign that the email is not legitimate.
- Be careful about what information you share online. Do not share your personal information, such as your Social Security number, credit card number, or bank account number, with anyone you don't know.
- Use strong passwords and keep them confidential. Phishing attacks often target passwords, so it is important to use strong passwords and to keep them confidential.
- Keep your software up to date. Software updates often include security patches that can help to protect you from phishing attacks.
- Report phishing attacks. If you receive a phishing email, report it to the appropriate authorities. This will help to protect others from falling victim to the same attack.
