<h1>Introduction to Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h1>

<h2>What is 2FA?</h2>

<p>2FA <em>(Two-Factor Authentication)</em> is an optional security measure that can be enabled on many websites and online services. It adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring you to provide two different pieces of information when you log in. This makes it much harder for attackers to access your account, even if they have your password.</p>

<h2>2FA Factors</h2>

<p>There are a few different types of 2FA factors that you can use:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Knowledge Factors:</strong> Something that you know, such as your password or PIN.</li>
    <li><strong>Possession Factors:</strong> Something that you have, such as your phone or a security token.</li>
    <li><strong>Inherence Factors:</strong> Something that you are, such as your fingerprint or iris scan.</li>
</ul>

<p>The type of 2FA factor that you use will depend on the specific website or online service that you are using.</p>
